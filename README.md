Hi üëãüèø, I'm Edithson Abelard, as a leader in technology, I aspire to build an environment that inspires the next generation of software engineers to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity. I believe in the power of technology to springboard positive change. This is more than just coding - finding solutions, tackling intricate problems, bridging the gap between dreams and aspirations, and cultivating reality through experience.

I commit to creating a culture that encourages continuous learning and exploration, where experience isn't limited to age or opportunity but to the desire for advancement. Breaking the wall of complexity and making transformative education available to kids and adults.

In a world where remaining stagnant is not an option. I pledge to provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities for our software engineers, game designers/developers, UX and future intrapreneurs, and entrepreneurs to grow, innovate, and excel.

Lastly, I value ethics in technology. As we progress, we must recognize the immense responsibility that accompanies software development. I am dedicated to instilling a strong sense of ethics in our developers, reminding them that every line of code they write can profoundly impact individuals and societies.

My vision is to empower, inspire, and guide the next generation of developers, providing them with the tools they need to create a future driven by innovative, responsible, and inclusive technology.

The foundation of this vision starts with me dedicating myself to a growth mindset, reading, writing, learning and sharing knowledge.

Breaking limits and becoming a limit breaker.
